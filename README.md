# Learn-Python3-for-ethical-hacking
All you need to learn python needed for ethical hacking is provided in this scripts. This is basically notes for you. If you are a beginner or a intermediate in python and want to learn ethical hacking, use this script to learn what's needed for ethical hacking in python perspective.

How to use this file?
If you are learning ethical hacking I am guessing that you are on kali linux. So first install python3 on kali machine. You can do this by- 'sudo apt install python3-pip' (without the quotes obviously)
So after doing that you are basically ready to go. So just change your directory to where the python.py is located. Use any text editor you wish, I personally use gedit or mousepad, but you can use any. Type in- '<text editor> python.py&' . So if i am using gedit i will type- 'gedit python.py&'. Don't forget the & because you can run the text editor and the terminal at same time.

How to begin learning?
All you gotta do is remove the # which is the comment sign in python, and run the code.

Please Note- DO NOT REMOVE THE # AFTER THE CODE. Fo example I have written- #variable = 5 #this is a integer.  Here you will have to remove the 1st # sign and not the 2nd one. The second one is only for telling you what it does so sorta like explaining what its used for.
For reference please see this video from TheCyberMentor-Ethical Hacking in 12 hours. These notes are provided from his video so all credit goes to him. I am just helping you if you are feeling dificulty.
Happy Learning!
